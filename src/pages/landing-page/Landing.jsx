        { q: "Can I make money using Muzoup?", a: "Yes. There are two ways you can make money via Muzoup. The first is from artist contributions towards the cost of creating content and promoting it. The second is through our referral scheme, which pays you for each artist who signs up to Muzoup using your unique referral link." },
        { q: "What are marketing contributions?", a: "Curators may request marketing contributions from artists, which help to cover the cost of promoting the content created using social media ads. Curators are only allowed to retain a maximum of 20% of this to cover their ad management time and asset creation." },
        { q: "Can I just provide coverage for free?", a: "Absolutely. It’s completely up to you whether you add an additional cost offer to artists. There are plenty of curators who provide free coverage on our platform." },
        { q: "Are there deadlines on submissions?", a: "We understand how busy it can get as a curator, so all tracks submitted via Muzoup will stay on the platform for three weeks from their date of release. However, you do have the option of saving tracks, which keeps them available after an artist’s three-week campaign has ended." },
        { q: "What kind of coverage can I offer?", a: "It’s important to note that there are strict rules about what can be offered in exchange for a contribution and what must always be offered for free. Radio plays, playlist spots and copy-and-pasted written coverage DO NOT QUALIFY and must always be offered for free. Only high-quality, original, bespoke coverage is allowed via Muzoup. Beyond coverage promoting an artist’s submission, this could also include graphic design, video editing, translations, social sharing bundles/stories, and influencer sharing." },
        { q: "Does Muzoup review each offer I make?", a: "Yes. Every offer made on our platform is reviewed and approved by Muzoup to maintain quality, value and fairness." },
        { q: "Does Muzoup review the coverage created by curators?", a: "Yes. We review all final content to make sure curators have held up their end of the deal and provided genuine value to the artist. Any funds due to the curator are not released until the content submitted has been approved by Muzoup." },
        { q: "How does the Marketplace work?", a: "The Marketplace flips our core Offers system, which lets you view artists’ submissions before choosing who to work with. The Marketplace lets you post specific promotions that artists can request directly. You can accept or decline requests and easily manage your workflow on our platform. Listing a promotion on the Marketplace is a great way for new curators to get started on Muzoup." },
        { q: "How else is Muzoup different from other platforms?", a: "In recent years, a number of music submission platforms have been established, on which the artists pays for a guaranteed listen and feedback. These platforms have made big steps in making curation more sustainable, but still have a long way to go in also being fair for the artist. The system has been abused by curators churning out stock feedback in order to receive their fee. There’s also no vetting process when artists submit to these platforms, so a lot of artists are submitting music that isn’t ready, and most likely submitting to the wrong curators too. With Muzoup, all artists’ submissions are quality-checked, and curators approach artists they like and want to promote, providing a considerably better service all round." },
